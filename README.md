🐻 Whac-A-Mole – Mini Game (Java)

A simple and fun Whac-A-Mole style mini game built using Java and developed in Visual Studio Code.
This project demonstrates Java Swing graphics, timers, mouse events, and game logic.



🎮 Game Overview

In this game:

Bears (moles) pop up randomly on the screen.
You must click the bear to score points.
If you click the tree instead of the bear, the game ends.
